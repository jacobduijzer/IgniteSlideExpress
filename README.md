# Ignite Slide Express

Ignite Slide Express is intended to be used for Ignite talks: talks where you have a maximum of 20 slides, and 5 minutes. The slides will auto-advance, no time to stop. It is used for conferences like the DevOpsDays. 

With Ignite Slide Express, you can create talks, upload PDF's and start the presentations.
